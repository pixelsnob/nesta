This estimate is assuming that the performance location is in the Los Angeles area. Set up and tear down are on our own time; pricing includes set up and tear down time of standard performance equipment.
These other factors may increase price:

* Additional travel
* Extra equipment
* Multiple performance locations
* Requested extra- early setup time
* Set up in sand/on the beach
* Overtime
* Performance in wedding ceremony (see below)
* Wedding receptions/MC'ing
* Performance on certain holidays

### Wedding Ceremony

||Pre-Ceremony & Ceremony<br>(up to 1.5 hours)|Pre-Ceremony, Ceremony & Cocktails<br>(up to 2.5 hours)|
|---|:---:|:---:|

|__Trio__|$750|$925|
|__Quartet__|$925|$1175|

* For cocktail hours ONLY use the standard pricing at
the top of page.
* Wedding ceremonies are priced a bit differently than "standard" performances (as listed above) because there's more musical prep beforehand, administrative tasks, coordination the day-of, and is a featured
performance. 
* We can learn one song not on our repertoire list, free of charge (subject to musical approval by musician(s). 
* Each couple is given a wedding questionnaire, on which they fill out logistical details and musical selections so things run smoothly for everyone the day-of. 
* Different instrument configurations available (from all steel drums to steel drums mixed with other instruments), but steel drums are main/lead instrument. Please inquire.
