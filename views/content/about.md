# About Nesta Steel Drum Band

![Nesta image](/user/images/1.jpg) Whether as a steel pan soloist, a steel pan trio, or as a full steel drum band, we will bring this enthusiasm to whatever your event may be. After all, we love steel drums and the genres of musi with which it is most identified: calypso, soca, and reggae. So if you're looking for great steel drum music, Caribbean music, island music, beach music, or tropical music, that's right down our alley. But, we also enjoy incorporating steel drums into music not regularly associated with its origins, such as blues, jazz, Latin, Brazilian, and even classical styles. And we're good at it! As steel drum musicians, we've studied, traveled to, and played with many of the most accomplished steel pan musicians from Trinidad. We listen to steel drum bands, calypso music, and other Caribbean music on our own time - because we love it. 

As musicians, we've been playing most of our lives and are professionally trained percussionists. And most of all, our passion for steel drums and steel pan music emerges through each performance.

Based in Santa Clarita, we regularly perform steel drums in Los Angeles, Valencia, Santa Clarita, Orange County, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Bakersfield, San Luis Obispo, the Inland Empire, and desert areas. Essentially, we play in many configurations - from a solo to a large steel drum band - in Southern California.
