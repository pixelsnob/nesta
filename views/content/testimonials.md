> What can I say...these two bring the vibe! 

> When my wife and I decided to have a steel drummer play during our wedding we weren't quite sure how people would receive it. They loved it, and so did we. I got so many compliments. Having two drummers is the way to go! The sound was perfect for our outdoor event. It traveled nicely, but didn't limit the guests ability to talk and catch up before the ceremony. I would recommend them to anyone wishing to bring a fun and uplifting twist the start of any special day. 

> Thank You NESTA!

> Nesta brought exquisite beats to my wedding day. Abby & Dan are very talented and very easy to work with. The relaxing and soothing Caribbean beats (along with traditional sounds) enhanced the atmosphere of my wedding day. I would recommend AND production to any couple or any one looking for marvelous music on their wedding day or event.

> Hello Abby- 

> Thank you so much for being with us at UCC. It was a total hit and though I was running around like a chicken with his head cut off, I did hear the wonderful music in air. I had several people express their enjoyment! Thanks again and I look forward to more involvement in the future! Blessings.

> Dan and Abby, 

> Sorry it took so long to get this note out….time flies….We just wanted you to know what a fabulous time we had at our birthday/anniversary party. Your entertainment and music was perfect.Everyone has told us what a great party we had, and unanimously commented on how special the music was. Dan and Butch were terrific. They seemed to know exactly what I wanted, and delivered a wonderful mix of delightful music. Dan is so talented and such a nice guy. I really struggle for words to describe how much we appreciate what your efforts added to our party; it was simply great!I have always liked the steel drum sound, now I’m even more of a fan. That sound just filled the canyon….it was SO cool.We would love to see you play at a bar/restaurant/club or other venue sometime. I’ll look at your web page and try to find where we could see you play again. We have given your name to several people who may someday request your talents.

> Thank you Dan, you were awesome,

> Thank you Abby,

> Hey Abby and Dan: 

> I just wanted to thank you both so very much for such a wonderful and professional experience "Nesta." Needless to say, Dan's playing and general "mensch" person he seems to be were a hit!!!! We all had a blast. I'll keep your card (and of course, pass it on) and hope to work with you in the future. Really appreciate the ease with which this was all coordinated.

> thanks again!!!!

> Abby played solo for our event. She was punctual and her music was great. She is a talented steel drummer and singer as well. All she needed was a single power connection and she took it from there. When she took breaks she had background music playing to fill the void. The guests really enjoyed her. I would recommend her highly to anyone looking for steel drums at their party.
